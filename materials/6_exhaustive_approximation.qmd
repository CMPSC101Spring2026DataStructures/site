# Course Overview

<!-- **Today's Learning Objectives:** -->

So, What are we talking about today?

- To understand exhaustive enumeration and iterative numerical techniques for approximation
- To study and understand how algorithms use approximations to find square and cube roots
- Compare efficiency of different approximation methods, and some of their limitations
- To explore primality testing using enumeration
- Implement practical Python solutions (code)

## Part1: Exhaustive Method 

Simple Exhaustive Square Roots

```{python}
# Exhaustive square root
def simple_square_root(x):
    # find a root of a perfect root
    ans = 0
    while ans **2 < abs(x):
        ans += 1
    if ans**2 != abs(x):
        print(f"x = {x} is not perfect square root...")
    else:
        if x<0:
            ans =-ans
        print(f"Square root of {x} is {ans}.")
```

We count and then square the result to compare to the absolute value of the number to check.

```{python}
simple_square_root(25) # find the square root of a square.
```

&nbsp;

```{python}
simple_square_root(26) # not a square ...

## `simple_square_root(x)`

*Count, square and check*

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. Start with `ans = 0`
2. Check if `ans²` < |x|
3. If true, increment `ans` by 1
4. Repeat until `ans²` ≥ |x|
5. Test if `ans²` exactly equals |x|
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key Logic:**
**Exhaustive search**: Tests every integer sequentially.

If `ans²` == |x| then the root is found. Cool!
<!--  **Perfect squares only**: Only finds exact integer roots -->
<!--  **Handles negatives**: Uses `abs(x)` then adjusts sign -->

**Binary outcome**: Either finds exact root or reports failure
:::

::::

---

<!-- &nbsp; -->

**Example:** For x = 25,

tests: 0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2 = 25 ✓

Be careful!

**Example:** For x = 26,

tests: 0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2 != 26

(We just passed the correct value!!)

<!-- ### Example: Simple Exhaustive Cube Roots -->

Simple Exhaustive Cube Roots (with same method)

&nbsp;

```{python}
# Exhaustive cube root
def simple_cube_root(x):
    # find a root of a perfect root
    ans = 0
    while ans **3 < abs(x):
        ans += 1
    if ans**3 != abs(x):
        print(f"x = {x} is not perfect cube root...")
    else:
        if x<0:
            ans =-ans
        print(f"Cube root of {x} is {ans}.")
```


---

Testing the Prototype

```{python}
simple_cube_root(8) # has a cube root
```

&nbsp;

```{python}
simple_cube_root(7) # does not have a cube ...
```

## `simple_cube_root(x)`

*Count, cube and check*

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step-by-Step Process:**

(Same as before)

1. Start with `ans = 0`
2. Check if `ans^3` < |x|
3. If true, increment `ans` by 1
4. Repeat until `ans^3` ≥ |x|
5. Test if `ans^3` exactly equals |x|
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key Logic:**
**Exhaustive search**: Tests every integer sequentially.

If `ans^3` == |x| then the root is found. Nifty!
<!--  **Perfect squares only**: Only finds exact integer roots -->
<!--  **Handles negatives**: Uses `abs(x)` then adjusts sign -->

**Binary outcome**: Either finds exact root or reports failure
:::

<!-- ::: {.column width="50%"} -->

tests: 0^3, 1^3, 2^3 = 8 ✓

**Be careful!**

For x = 9,
tests: 0^3, 1^3, 2^3, 3^3 != 9

# How to Generalize This?

Exhaustive *n*th root
```{python}
def simple_n_root(x, n):
    # find a root of a perfect root
    ans = 0
    while ans **n < abs(x):
        ans += 1
    if ans**n != abs(x):
        print(f"x = {x} is not perfect {n} root...")
    else:
        if x<0:
            ans =-ans
        print(f"{n} root of {x} is {ans}.")
```


---

Testing the Prototype

```{python}
simple_n_root(8,2) # find the square root
```

&nbsp;

```{python}
simple_n_root(17,2) # not a square ...
```

&nbsp;



```{python}
simple_n_root(9,3) # not a cube ...

## Complicated Exhaustive Square Roots

Add print statements to see steps.
```{python}
def exhaustive_sqrt(x, epsilon=0.01):
    """
    Find square root using exhaustive enumeration
    """
    step = epsilon
    num_guesses = 0
    ans = 0.0
    
    print(f"Finding square root of {x}")
    
    while abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon and ans*ans <= x:
        ans += step
        num_guesses += 1
    
    print(f"Number of guesses: {num_guesses}")
    
    if abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon:
        print(f"Failed to find square root of {x}")
        return None
    else:
        print(f"Square root of {x} is approximately {ans}")
        return ans


```

---

Testing the Prototype

```{python}
exhaustive_sqrt(25) # find the square root of a square.
```

```{python}
exhaustive_sqrt(26) # Not a square ...
```

<center>
![](graphics/test_it_ii.png){width=35%}
</center>

---

## **How This Code Works:**

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Start with `ans = 0.0`
2. Increment by `epsilon` each iteration
3. Check if `ans²` is close enough to `x`
4. Stop when within tolerance or exceeded target

**Key Variables:**
- `step`: How much to increment each guess
- `num_guesses`: Performance counter
- `ans`: Current approximation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Loop Condition Explained:**
- `abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon`: Not accurate enough yet
- `ans*ans <= x`: Haven't exceeded target (prevents infinite loop)

**Why It Works:**
- Systematically tests every possible value
- Guaranteed to find solution if it exists
- Simple but inefficient for large numbers
:::

## The Fundamental Limitation

**These functions use "exhaustive enumeration" over integers:**

- **Perfect squares/cubes:** Have integer roots (4, 9, 16, 25...)
- **Non-perfect squares/cubes:** Have irrational/decimal roots

**Key Insight:** The algorithm design assumes the answer is an integer!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```python
# This works:
simple_square_root (25) = 5
simple_square_root(27) = 3

# (only exact integers)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```python
# This fails:
simple_square_root(26) = 5.099... 
simple_cube_root(26) = 2.962...

# (not integers, no results found
```
:::

## Part2: Approximation

What if I need exact numbers for roots of a non-perfect value?

My number is ...

* Not a square 
* Not a cube
* Not an $n^{th}$ value of anything!


<center>
How to find exact values of *any* number I want?!
</center>

---


## What We Need Instead

**For approximating non-perfect roots, we need:**

1. **Decimal precision** (not just integers)
2. **Tolerance/epsilon** (how close is "close enough?")
3. **Different search strategies:**
   - Increment by small decimals (0.01, 0.001...)
   <!-- - Bisection search -->
   - Newton's method

**Next:** We'll explore these *approximation* techniques!


---

## So, What is *Approximation*?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key Concepts:**

- Finding "good enough" solutions
- Trading precision for efficiency
- Iterative refinement
- Stopping criteria (stop the approximation by setting precision)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Like, Why Approximation?**

- Exact solutions may not exist (not a perfect number)
<!-- - Computational limitations -->
- Real-world applications (like how your computer does this root-finding!)
<!-- - Performance trade-offs -->
:::

::::

<!-- 
---
* Exhaustive enumeration systematically checks all possibilities to guarantee a correct solution.
* Best for small, finite problems,

However, Newtons Method.

* Newton's method is an iterative numerical technique that rapidly approximates a solution by using tangent lines, but it is not guaranteed to find the correct answer and can fail. 
* Suited for finding accurate numerical solutions to complex equations when exhaustive checking is impossible.

## Square Root Approximation with Newton's Method

<center>
![](graphics/newtons_method.png){width=60%}
</center>
---

<!-- &nbsp; -->

```{python}
def newtons_sqrt(n:float, guess:float = 1.0) -> float:
    while abs(n - guess*guess) > .0001:
        print(f"n = {n}, guess = {guess}")
        print(f"   abs(n - guess*guess) = {abs(n - guess*guess)}")
        guess = guess - (guess*guess - n)/(2*guess)
        print(f"   guess = guess - (guess*guess - n)/(2*guess) = {guess}\n")

    return guess
```

 
<center>
![](graphics/newtons_method.png){width=50%}
</center>

---

Test using debug print statements ... 

```{python}
my_num = 25
result = newtons_sqrt(my_num)
print(f"Verification:\n {result}^2 = ")
print(f"{result**2} is {result**2 == result**2}")

```
---

<!-- ## **How This Code Works:** -->

So, how does this thing work?

* Each approximation of $x$ is from Equation: $x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}$
  * We approach the actual value with each iteration
* The $\frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}$ term allows for us to get closer to the actual number with each approximation.
  * $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ to $x_{2}$ to, ..., to $x_{n}$

## Cube Roots

```{python}
def newtons_cube_root(n:float, guess:float = 1.0) -> float:
    while abs(n - guess*guess*guess) > .0001:
        print(f"n = {n}, guess = {guess}")
        print(f"   abs(n - guess^3) = {abs(n - guess*guess*guess)}")
        guess = guess - (guess*guess*guess - n)/(3*(guess*guess))
        print(f"   guess = guess - (guess*guess*guess - n)/(3*(guess*guess)) = {guess}\n")
    return guess

Exhaustive enumeration and Newton's method are fundamentally different problem-solving techniques: exhaustive enumeration systematically checks all possibilities to guarantee a correct solution, while Newton's method is an iterative numerical technique that rapidly approximates a solution by using tangent lines, but it is not guaranteed to find the correct answer and can fail.
