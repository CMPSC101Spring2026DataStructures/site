<!-- # What is "Complexity" Anyway? 🤔 -->

## Complexity is All About **How Things Scale** 📈

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}

**Complexity** = How much **more work** do you need when you have **more stuff** to deal with?

**Real-Life Examples:**

* 🍕 **Making dinner for friends:** 2 friends vs 20 friends - how much more work?
* 📚 **Finding a book:** In a small pile vs a huge library - how much longer?
* 🎁 **Gift wrapping:** 5 gifts vs 50 gifts - how much more time?
* 👋 **Meeting everyone at a party:** 10 people vs 100 people - how many more handshakes?
:::

# The Big Question 💭

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## **When you double the amount of "stuff," what happens to the amount of work?**

* Does it stay the same? 
* Double too? 
* Get **way** worse?
* Or explode completely?

**That's what complexity tells us!** 🎯

Let's explore each complexity level! 🚀
:::

## O(1) - The Magic Trick Level ⚡

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## **"No Matter How Much, It Takes the Same Time!"** 🎪

**O(1) means:** Whether you have 1 thing or 1 million things, the task takes exactly the same amount of time!
:::

::: {.callout icon="true"}
**Everyday O(1) Examples:**

🔑 **Using a key to open your door** - Same one turn always!

💡 **Turning on a light switch** - Same flip always!

📱 **Checking the time on your phone** - Always instant!

🏧 **Using your debit card** - Same swipe time always!

:::


## Why O(1) is Amazing ⚡

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## **The Holy Grail of Algorithms!** 🏆

✨ **It's like magic** - the amount of work **never changes**

🎯 **Perfect performance** - always fast, always reliable

🚀 **Every programmer dreams of O(1) solutions!**
:::


::: {.callout icon="False"}
**Real-World O(1) Examples:**

* 📞 Your phone's "Recent Calls" list
* 📱 Looking up a contact by name  
* 💳 Checking account balance
* 🎵 Skipping to specific song
:::

## O(log n) - The Smart Detective Level 🕵️

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## **"Cut the Problem in Half, Over and Over!"** 🔍

**O(log n) means:** Each step eliminates half of what's left to search. Super efficient even with huge amounts!
:::

::: {.callout icon="true"}

**Everyday O(log n) Examples:**

🎯 **Guessing a number 1-1000** - Cut problem in half each time, found in ~10 questions max!

📖 **Finding word in dictionary** - Open to middle, go left or right, found in seconds!

🎪 **20 Questions game** - Each question eliminates half the possibilities

🔍 **Phone contact search** - Type "J" → cuts to J names, type "Jo" → even fewer options

:::

## Why O(log n) is Amazing 🏆

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## **Incredible Scaling Performance!** 📊

**Amazing scaling:**
* 1,000 items → ~10 steps
* 1,000,000 items → ~20 steps  
* 1,000,000,000 items → ~30 steps

🧠 **Smart strategy beats brute force**
:::


::: {.callout icon="true"}
**Used everywhere:**

* 🔍 Google searches
* 🗺️ GPS route finding
* 📱 Phone contact search
:::

## But What's the Catch?

<center>
![](graphics/catch.png){width=35%}
</center>

::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## **The catch:** You need things **organized first!** 📋
:::

## O(n) - The One-by-One Level 🚶

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## **"Check Every Single Thing, One by One"** 👀

**O(n) means:** Double the stuff = Double the work. Fair and predictable!
:::

::: {.callout icon="False"}

**Everyday O(n) Examples:**

📚 **Reading every page in a book** - 100 pages = 100 page flips, 200 pages = 200 page flips

🛒 **Counting items in shopping cart** - Must touch each item once, 10 items = 10 counts

🎵 **Listening to playlist** - 50 songs = 50× the time

📝 **Grading test stack** - 30 tests = 30× the work
:::

## Why O(n) is Pretty Good ✅

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## **Predictable and Fair!** 📈

✅ **Predictable and fair** - work scales linearly

🎯 **Often the best you can do** when you need to check everything

📈 **Reasonable for most tasks:**
* Finding highest grade
* Adding up expenses
* Reading all text messages
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## **When it gets slow:** 
Really large amounts of data - but still very manageable for normal use! 🎯
:::

## O(n²) - The Handshake Problem Level 🤝

::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## **"Everyone Must Meet Everyone Else!"** 😰

**O(n²) means:** When you double the people, you get **four times** the work! This gets crazy fast.
:::

::: {.callout icon="False"}

**Everyday O(n²) Examples:**

🤝 **Party introductions** - 4 people = 6 handshakes, 8 people = 28 handshakes, 16 people = 120 handshakes!

🏆 **Sports tournament** - Everyone plays everyone, gets expensive fast!

👥 **Group photo arrangements** - Every person next to every other, gets overwhelming quickly!

📝 **Comparing all student tests** - Looking for identical answers, 30 students = 435 comparisons!

:::

## Why O(n²) Gets Scary 📈

::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## **Explosive Growth!** 💥

📈 **Explosive growth:**
* 10 things → 100 operations
* 100 things → 10,000 operations
* 1,000 things → 1,000,000 operations!

⚠️ **The danger zone** - where apps become unusably slow
:::


::: {.callout icon="False"}
🐌 **Common culprits:**
* Comparing every item to every other
* Nested loops in programming
* Poor algorithm choices
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## **When to worry:** Anything over ~1,000 items gets really slow! 🚨
:::

## O(2ⁿ) - The Explosion Level 💥

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## **"Every Choice Doubles Your Problems!"** 🤯

**O(2ⁿ) means:** Add just one more thing, and you **double** all the work! This explodes instantly.
:::

::: {.callout icon="False"}

**Everyday O(2ⁿ) Examples:**

🧬 **Family tree exploration** - 2 parents → 4 grandparents → 8 great-grandparents → 16 great-great-grandparents

<!-- 🍕 **Pizza topping combinations** - 1 topping = 2 choices, 10 toppings = 1,024 combinations! -->

🔐 **Password cracking** - Each digit doubles possibilities, 10-digit PIN = 1+ billion combos!

🎁 **Gift wrapping combinations** - Each gift: wrapped or not, 20 gifts = 1+ million combinations!

:::

## Why O(2ⁿ) is Terrifying 💀

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## **Grows Impossibly Fast!** 🚨

💀 **Grows impossibly fast:**
* 10 things → 1,024 operations
* 20 things → 1,048,576 operations  
* 30 things → 1,073,741,824 operations!

🚫 **Usually unusable** for anything but *tiny* problems
:::

::: {.callout icon="False"}

⏰ **Real-world impact:**
* Why cryptography works (good!)
* Why some problems are "impossible" (bad!)
:::


::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## **Bottom line:** Avoid at all costs unless you have < 20 items! ⚠️
:::

## The Complexity Race! 🏃‍♀️💨

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## **How They Compare With 1,000 Items** 🏁

Let's see what happens when we have 1,000 things to process:
:::

## The Complexity Race Table 🏃‍♀️💨

::: {.callout icon="false"}
| Complexity | Name | Steps Needed | Real-World Feeling |
|------------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **O(1)** | Magic Trick | **1 step** | ⚡ Instant! |
| **O(log n)** | Smart Detective | **~10 steps** | 🏃 Super fast! |
| **O(n)** | One-by-One | **1,000 steps** | 🚶 Takes a moment |
| **O(n²)** | Handshake Problem | **1,000,000 steps** | 🐌 Ugh, so slow... |
| **O(2ⁿ)** | Explosion | **2¹⁰⁰⁰ steps** | 💀 Heat death of universe |
