## Welcome to the World of Python Libraries! 🌟

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Why Use Modules? 🤔

**Modules are like LEGO blocks for programming!** Instead of building everything from scratch, we can use pre-built pieces that experts have already created.

**Real-World Analogy**: 
* Like using a **calculator app** instead of building your own calculator
* Like using **GPS navigation** instead of memorizing every road
* Like using a **recipe book** instead of inventing cooking from scratch!

:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**What You Get** 📦

* **Pre-written functions** - tested and reliable
* **Specialized tools** - for math, dates, files, web
* **Time savings** - focus on your logic, not reinventing wheels
* **Professional quality** - used by millions of developers

**Today's Journey** 🗺️

1. **Part 1**: Using built-in modules (`calendar`, `math`, `random`)
2. **File Basics**: Reading and writing `.txt` and `.csv` files  
3. **Part 2**: Creating your own custom modules

**Magic Question**: *"What amazing things can I build when I have the right tools?"*

## The `import` Statement - Your Magic Key! 🔑

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## How to Access Python's Treasure Chest

The `import` statement is like having a **key to a massive toolshed** filled with specialized tools!

:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Basic Import Syntax** 

```python
# Method 1: Import entire module
import math
result = math.sqrt(16)  # Use math.function_name

# Method 2: Import specific functions
from math import sqrt, pi
result = sqrt(16)       # Use function directly
area = pi * radius**2

# Method 3: Import with nickname
import calendar as cal
print(cal.month_name[3])  # March

# Method 4: Import everything (be careful!)
from math import *
result = sqrt(16)       # All functions available
```
:::

::: {.column}
**Best Practices** 🏆

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Clear what you're using
import math
import calendar as cal
from random import randint

# ✅ GOOD: Import specific items
from math import sqrt, pi, sin, cos

# ⚠️ BE CAREFUL: Importing everything
from math import *  # Can cause name conflicts

# 💡 TIP: Check what's available
import math
print(dir(math))  # Shows all available functions
```

**Pro Tip**: Import statements go at the top of your file!

## Exploring the `calendar` Module 📅

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Time Travel with Python!

The `calendar` module lets you work with dates, find specific days, and even create calendars for any year!

:::

```python
import calendar as cal

# Display a full month calendar
print(cal.month(2025, 11))  # November 2025

# Get information about dates
print(f"Today is: {cal.day_name[cal.weekday(2025, 11, 4)]}")  # Monday

# Find which day of week a date falls on (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
day_number = cal.weekday(2025, 12, 25)  # Christmas 2025
print(f"Christmas 2025 falls on: {cal.day_name[day_number]}")

# Get month as nested lists (perfect for programming!)
month_calendar = cal.monthcalendar(2025, 11)
print("November 2025 as lists:")
for week in month_calendar:
    print(week)  # Each week is a list [Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun]
```

    # Get November calendar as nested lists
    november = cal.monthcalendar(year, 11)
    
    # Find 4th Thursday
    # Check if first week has Thursday
    if november[0][cal.THURSDAY] != 0:
        # First week has Thursday, so 4th is week 3 (0-indexed)
        thanksgiving = november[3][cal.THURSDAY]
    else:
        # First week has no Thursday, so 4th is week 4
        thanksgiving = november[4][cal.THURSDAY]
    
    return thanksgiving

# Test it out!
for year in [2024, 2025, 2026]:
    day = find_thanksgiving(year)
    print(f"Thanksgiving {year}: November {day}")
```

::: {.column}
**Weekend Counter** 📊

```python
def count_weekends_in_month(year, month):
    """Count how many Saturdays and Sundays in a month"""
    month_cal = cal.monthcalendar(year, month)
    saturdays = sundays = 0
    
    for week in month_cal:
        if week[cal.SATURDAY] != 0:  # 0 means no day
            saturdays += 1
        if week[cal.SUNDAY] != 0:
            sundays += 1
    
    return saturdays, sundays

# How many weekend days in December 2025?
sat, sun = count_weekends_in_month(2025, 12)
print(f"December 2025: {sat} Saturdays, {sun} Sundays")
print(f"Total weekend days: {sat + sun}")
```

print(f"Distance: {distance(0, 0, 3, 4)}")  # 5.0
```
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Rather than having to write code to approximate things, have the `math` library do it for you!

**Q**: Why use a library in Python, anyway?

**A**: You would use a library to make your code more readable (and *trustworthy*) to a maintainer. Having a published library fit to handle your heavy lifting help to ensure smooth operation which will facilitate maintenance.

    # Diameter = 2 × r
    diameter = 2 * radius
    
    return {
        'radius': radius,
        'diameter': diameter,

Interestingly, there is nothing really random about this generator -- all numbers come from a look-up system. If you want truly random numbers, then you will have to use another system.

**Q**: Would this random number generator library serve in security applications?

**A**: The Random library is used for low security applications.

## Reading Text Files 📖

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
**Step-by-Step File Reading**

Reading files is like opening a book - you need to open it, read the contents, then close it when done! When you use `open()`, then you have to close the book. 

⚠️ To try these examples, make sure you have the file available!
:::
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
```python
# Method 1: Basic file reading (manual close)
file = open('student_essay.txt', 'r')  # 'r' = read mode
content = file.read()  # Read entire file
print(content)
file.close()  # Always close the file!
```

```python
##############################

# Method 2: Read line by line
file = open('student_essay.txt', 'r')
for line_number, line in enumerate(file, 1):
    print(f"Line {line_number}: {line.strip()}")  # strip() removes \n
file.close()
```

```python
##############################

# Method 3: Best practice - using 'with' (auto-closes!)
with open('student_essay.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# File automatically closes when indented block ends!
```
:::



## Wait! What's the Code Doing?

::: {.callout-important}
Before we move forward, let's look at the code that opens files.
:::


::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
```python

myFile = "jokes.txt"

# Open the text file, display a random joke

	jokes = file.readlines() # pull all lines from the file
	random_joke = random.choice(jokes).strip() # select a random joke
	print(random_joke)
```
:::

:::
::: {.column}

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}

```python
with open(myFile,"r") as file:
    jokes = file.readlines()
```
* `myfile` is a string variable
* Opens the `myfile` in **read** mode (not **write** mode) 
* `as file:` file content is saved in `file` which is a `TextIOWrapper` object

# Writing Files 📝

## Let Python WRITE For You! 📝

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
**Step-by-Step File Writing**

Writing files is like creating a document - you need to open it, write your content, then close it to save! When you use `open()` with write mode, you can save data permanently.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
```python
# Method 1: Basic file writing (manual close)
file = open('my_notes.txt', 'w')  # 'w' = write mode (overwrites!)
file.write('This is my first note.\n')
file.write('This is my second note.\n')
file.close()  # Always close to save!
```

```python
##############################

# Method 2: Writing multiple lines at once
file = open('shopping_list.txt', 'w')
items = ['Apples\n', 'Bananas\n', 'Milk\n', 'Bread\n']
file.writelines(items)  # Write all lines at once
file.close()
```

```python
##############################

# Method 3: Best practice - using 'with' (auto-closes!)
with open('diary.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Today was a great day!\n')
    file.write('I learned about file writing in Python.\n')
# File automatically saves and closes when indented block ends!
```
:::


## Important: Write Modes Explained! ⚠️

::: {.callout-warning}
**Be Careful with File Modes!**

Different modes do different things - choose wisely!
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
| Mode | Name | What It Does | Danger Level |
|------|------|--------------|--------------|
| `'w'` | Write | Creates new file or **OVERWRITES** existing file | 🔴 High - Deletes old content! |
| `'a'` | Append | Adds to end of existing file or creates new | 🟢 Safe - Keeps old content |
| `'r'` | Read | Opens file for reading only | 🟢 Safe - Can't change file |
| `'x'` | Exclusive | Creates new file, **FAILS** if exists | 🟢 Safe - Won't overwrite |
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
```python
# DANGER: This erases all old content!
with open('notes.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('New content replaces everything!\n')

# SAFE: This adds to the end
with open('notes.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write('This line gets added to the end.\n')
```
:::


## Real Example: Creating a To-Do List 📝

::: {.callout-important}
Let's see file writing in action with a practical example!
:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
```python
# Create a to-do list file
todo_file = "my_tasks.txt"

# Write initial tasks
with open(todo_file, "w") as file:
    file.write("To-Do List for Today\n")
    file.write("=" * 25 + "\n")
    file.write("1. Study Python\n")
    file.write("2. Complete homework\n")
    file.write("3. Exercise for 30 min\n")

print("To-do list created!")

# Later: Add more tasks
with open(todo_file, "a") as file:
    file.write("4. Call mom\n")
    file.write("5. Read chapter 3\n")

print("Tasks added!")
```
:::

:::
::: {.column}

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
**What's Happening?**

```python
with open(todo_file, "w") as file:
    file.write("To-Do List for Today\n")
```

* `todo_file` is a string variable with filename
* Opens file in **write** mode (creates or overwrites)
* `as file:` gives us a file object to work with
* `file.write()` writes text to the file
* `\n` creates a new line (line break)
* File auto-saves when `with` block ends!

<!-- **Result File:** `my_tasks.txt`
```
To-Do List for Today
=========================
1. Study Python
2. Complete homework
3. Exercise for 30 min
4. Call mom
5. Read chapter 3

## Using CSV Files - Structured Data! 📊

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## CSV = Comma Separated Values

CSV files are perfect for data that fits in rows and columns, like spreadsheets!

:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}

    print(f"Headers: {headers}")
    
    for row_number, row in enumerate(csv_reader, 1):
        print(f"Student {row_number}: {row}")

# Reading CSV files - Method 2: Dictionary reader (easier!)
with open('students.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)  # Treats first row as headers
    
    for student in csv_reader:
        name = student['Name']
        grade = student['Grade']
        subject = student['Subject']
        print(f"{name} got {grade}% in {subject}")

# Writing CSV files
student_data = [

    ['Diana', 16, 89, 'English']
]

with open('new_students.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    # newline='' prevents extra blank lines in CSV on Windows
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)
