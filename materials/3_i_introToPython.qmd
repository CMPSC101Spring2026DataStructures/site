# Welcome to Python Programming!

::: {.callout-tip}
**Let's make learning Python fun and practical!**
:::

---

## What are literals?

Literals are fixed values in your code. They can be numbers, strings, booleans, etc.

::: {.callout-note}
**Examples:**
- `42` (integer)
- `3.14` (float)
- `'hello'` (string)
- `True`, `False` (boolean)
:::

## Python Code Sample

```python
age = 18
pi = 3.14159
greeting = "Hello, world!"
is_active = True
```

## Interesting Application

Use literals to set default values in games, apps, or data analysis scripts!

---

# Python Literals

Literals are fixed values written directly in your code and are used to assign values to variables or as standalone values in expressions.

<!-- ::: {.example-large} -->
::: {.example}
```python
"""
This example shows different types of literals.
"""
integer_literal = 42        # An integer literal
float_literal = 3.14        # A floating-point literal
string_literal = "hello"    # A string literal
boolean_literal = True      # A boolean literal

print(integer_literal, float_literal, string_literal, boolean_literal)
# Output: 42 3.14 hello True
```
:::
This code demonstrates how to use different types of literals in Python.

---

# Variables and Operators

Variables store data for use in your program which can be manipulated by *operators* (e.g., addition, comparison, and assignment).

<!-- ::: {.example-large} -->
::: {.example}
```python
"""
This example shows how to use variables and operators.
"""
x = 10      # Assign 10 to x
y = 5       # Assign 5 to y
sum_xy = x + y         # Addition operator
diff_xy = x - y        # Subtraction operator
prod_xy = x * y        # Multiplication operator
is_equal = x == y      # Comparison operator
print(sum_xy, diff_xy, prod_xy, is_equal)
# Output: 15 5 50 False
```
:::
This code uses variables and operators to do math and compare values.

---

# Loops and Conditionals

Loops repeat actions. Conditionals let your code make decisions.

<!-- ::: {.example-large} -->
::: {.example}
```python
"""
This example prints numbers and checks if they are even or odd.
"""

for i in range(1, 6):  # Loop from 1 to 5
    if i % 2 == 0:     # Conditional: is i even?
        print(f"{i} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is odd")
# Output:
# 1 is odd
# 2 is even
# ... and similar up to 5
```
:::
This code loops through numbers and uses a conditional to check if each is even or odd.

---

# Squaring Algorithms

Squaring means multiplying a number by itself. There are several ways to do this in Python.

<!-- ::: {.example-large} -->
::: {.example}
```python
"""
This example shows three ways to square a number.
"""
def square(n):
    """Returns the square of n."""
    return n * n

num = 7
squ1 = num * num         # Multiplication
squ2 = num ** 2          # Exponentiation

print(f"squ1: {squ1}, squ2: {squ2}, square(num): {square(num)}")
# Output: squ1: 49, squ2: 49, square(num): 49
```
:::
This code demonstrates three ways to square a number in Python.

---

# Strings and Slicing

Strings store text. Slicing lets you extract parts of a string.

<!-- ::: {.example-large} -->
::: {.example}
```python
"""
This example slices a string in different ways.
"""

text = "Python is awesome!"

first_word = text[:6]      # Get 'Python'
last_word = text[-8:]      # Get 'awesome!'
every_other = text[::2]    # Get every other character

print(first_word)    # Output: Python
print(last_word)     # Output: awesome!
print(every_other)   # Output: Pto saeo!
```
:::
This code shows how to slice strings to get different parts or patterns.

# Python Challenge Exercises

Try these programming challenges to practice your Python skills!

---

## Challenge 1: Literal Mix-Up

Write code that uses at least three different types of literals (integer, float, string, boolean) and prints them in a single sentence.

::: {.example}
```python
# TODO
```
:::

---

## Challenge 2: Variable Math

Create two variables, perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and print the results with clear labels.

::: {.example}
```python
# TODO
```
:::

---

## Challenge 3: Loop & Conditional Fun

Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10. For each number, print whether it is a multiple of 3 or not.

::: {.example}
```python
# TODO
```
:::

---

## Challenge 4: Squaring Game

Write a function that takes a number and returns both its square and its cube. Print the results for the number 5.

::: {.example}
```python
# TODO
```
:::

---

## Challenge 5: String Slicing Mystery

Given the string `mystery = "QuartoPythonRocks!"`, print:

- The first 6 characters
- The last 5 characters
- Every third character

::: {.example}
```python
# TODO
```
:::
